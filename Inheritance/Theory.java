//todo --------------Inheritance----------------

//^ A class achiving a properties of another class is known as inheritance.
//^ Inheritance is also known as IS-A relationship.
//^ A class sharing the properties is called Super class/Base class/Parent class
//^ A class aquiring the properties is called Sub class/derived class/child class
//^ class inherit the properties of another class using EXTENDS keyword.
//^ class inherit the properperies of a interface using IMPLEMENTS keyword.
//^ In java, only variables and methods are inherited . blocks and constrctors are not inherited.
//^ Java, does not support multiple inheritance with respect to classes.
//^ Multiple inheritance is possible with respect to interface.

//^ Advantage of inheritance:
//! code reuasibility
//! polymorphism
//! Easy maintainance

//^ Use of inheritance :
//! to avoid code dublication
//! used to achive code reuasbility
//! used to achieve generalization
//! indirectly helps to achieve run time polymorphism

//? Types of Inheritance
//& Single level inheritance
//& Multi level inheritance
//& Multiple inheritance
//& Hierarchical inheritance
//& Hybrid Inheritance

//& Single level inheritance
//! It is a combination of one sub class and one super class

//& Multi level inheritance
//! Combination of multiple sub class and multiple super class

//& Multiple inheritance
//! combination of one sub class and multiple super class

//& Hierarchical inheritance
//! combination of multiple subclass with one super class

//& Hybrid inheritance
//! Combination of multiple inheritance and hierarchical inheritance
//! Its a combination of two or more type of inheritance.
